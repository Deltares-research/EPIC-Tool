    <v-textarea rows=20 value="River basin plans guide the development, management, allocation, and use of water and related resources within a specific geographical area. Ideally, this is an actual river basin, but in some cases the planning area may be limited due to transboundary constraints or in order to ensure a more tractable planning size. In some countries, a single river basin is simply too large to plan as a single unit, so it is necessary to divide it into sub-basins. River basin plans are typically integrated plans, addressing water quantity, water quality, surface water and groundwater, and the protection of water and aquatic ecosystems while enabling the integration of upstream and downstream interests. Basin plans should also include issues such as institutional responsibilities, implementation arrangements, budgets, and monitoring. It is important that droughts and floods are addressed in a river basin plan as set out in the following paragraphs:                                                                                                                                               •	Basin Drought Planning: A river basin plan should identify the impacts of various drought scenarios and recommend water resources-related mitigation strategies for minimizing drought impacts, including watershed management actions, the need for and location of new infrastructure, reservoir operations, and urban and agricultural water conservation and efficiency, as well as water allocation priorities. As part of, or in parallel to, the river basin management plan, a Basin Drought Contingency Plan should also be prepared that lays out specific actions to be taken at the basin level depending upon the level of drought severity. Those actions could include mandatory conservation measures, reallocation of water supplies, restrictions on agricultural production, different types of urban water use, or changes to reservoir operations. The Basin Drought Contingency Plan should be informed by assessments of risks and of vulnerable populations to help balance objectives and set priorities.

  •	Basin Flood Planning: A river basin management plan should also identify the potential impacts of various flood scenarios and recommend water resources-related mitigation strategies for minimizing flood risk, including watershed management actions, new water resource infrastructure, and protection of floodplains and wetlands as designated retention areas. As discussed in Chapter 10, the river basin management plan should inform land use planning and related decisions with respect to flood risks at the local level. As part of, or in parallel to the Basin Plan, a Basin Flood Contingency Plan should also be prepared. Such a plan should lay out specific actions to be taken depending upon the level of flood severity. Those actions could include emergency operations of reservoirs, decision rules on controlled flooding, and emergency actions such as mobilizing flood-fighting teams and evacuating populations.
